                [Bio] Mickey Mouse is an animated cartoon character co-created in 1928 by Walt Disney 
                and Ub Iwerks. The longtime mascot of The Walt Disney Company, Mickey is an 
                anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white 
                gloves. Taking inspiration from such silent film personalities as Charlie Chaplin’s 
                Tramp, Mickey is traditionally characterized as a sympathetic underdog who gets by 
                on pluck and ingenuity.[2] The character’s status as a small mouse was personified 
                through his diminutive stature and falsetto voice, the latter of which was originally 
                provided by Disney. Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable and universally 
                acclaimed fictional characters of all time.

                [Bio] Charles "Charlie" Brown (called Chuck by Peppermint Patty and sometimes referred 
                to as his full name by Marcie) is a major character in the Peanuts comic strip by 
                Charles M. Schulz. He has been hailed as one of the best cartoon characters of all time, 
                and he has become one of the great American archetypes. In terms of personality, he is 
                gentle, insecure, and lovable. Charlie Brown possesses significant determination and 
                hope but frequently fails because of his insecurities, outside interference, or plain 
                bad luck. While he can be smart, he over-thinks things and this often gives him a 
                tendency to procrastinate, as well as give him his "wishy-washyness".
